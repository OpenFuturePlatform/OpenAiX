# OpenAiX

Welcome to our Public AI Chat Assistant App repository! This project aims to create a user-friendly chat application with an AI assistant powered by advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. With this app, users can engage in conversations, ask questions, and receive helpful responses from our AI assistant.

Open is now developing privately in a private repo project represented by this Repo. This project aims to combine Open's infrastructure with AI & communications technology.

## Technology implementation

### Kotlin
Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language designed to make developers happier. It's concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.  
### Kotlin Multi Platform
The Kotlin Multiplatform technology is designed to simplify the development of cross-platform projects. It reduces time spent writing and maintaining the same code for different platforms while retaining the flexibility and benefits of native programming.
